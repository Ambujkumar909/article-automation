    title: 'The Singularity of Silicon',
    description: 'An exploration of neural networks and the inevitable intersection of carbon and silicon life.',
    originalContent: 'In the coming decades, computers will become faster. We might see machines that think. This will change society. Experts believe neural networks are the key to this future. However, we must be careful about safety.',
    updatedContent: 'The dawn of the silicon era is no longer a distant horizon. As neural architectures transcend simple compute cycles, we witness a profound synthesis of cognition and circuitry. This paradigm shift mandates a rigorous ethical framework to ensure that artificial sentience aligns with human flourishing.',

    title: 'Minimalist Architecture in Urban Spaces',
    description: 'How reducing structural complexity enhances psychological well-being in dense city environments.',
    originalContent: 'Cities are crowded and loud. Architects are now trying to make buildings simpler. Use less materials. More light. People like it more because it is quiet. This makes city life better for everyone.',
    updatedContent: 'Urban density often translates to sensory overload. Modern minimalist praxis seeks to alleviate this cognitive burden through reductive geometry and luminous voids. By prioritizing spatial clarity over ornamental excess, architects are fostering contemplative sanctuaries within the metropolitan noise.',

    title: 'The Ethics of Genetic Augmentation',
    description: 'Defining the boundary between therapeutic intervention and human optimization.',
    originalContent: 'Doctors can now fix genes. This is good for diseases. But some people want to change genes for better eyes or height. Is this right? We need laws to stop people from going too far with DNA editing.',
    updatedContent: 'The CRISPR revolution has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to clinical reality. While genomic editing offers unprecedented hope for eradicating hereditary pathologies, it simultaneously invites a precarious era of bio-social stratification. We must delineate the boundary between restoration and augmentation.',
